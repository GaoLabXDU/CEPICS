# CEPIM

CEPIM: a comparison and evaluation platform for integration methods in cancer subtyping.

## How to install

Download [CEPIM_1.0.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPIM/releases/download/v1.0.0/CEPIM_1.0.0.tar.gz). 

Install R package locally from R studio.

## How to use

Just enter the data and some parameters to get the report.
```R
CEPIM(datalist, datatype = c("gaussian", "gaussian", "gaussian"),
    functionList = list('PINS', 'LRA', 'SNF', 'iCluster', 'PFA'),
    evalList = list('Heatmap','KM', 'SI', 'ARI', 'RI', 'NMI'), kMax=5)
```
For more details, please see this Guideline ***(Guideline file)*** or the help in this R package.

## Reports
Here, we present four reports generated by CEPIM for four scenarios.

***Please download the report to your local computer, and modify the extension name to ".html" before open the file.***

The reports generated by CEPIM include **two parts**. 
**The first part** shows the *comparison of subtyping results across different methods and different number of subtypes*, including time consumption, Cox p-value, NMI, ARI, silhouette coefficient. Then, we present an overall samples similarity heatmap representing a robust prediction for sample pairwise similarities. 

There are two comparison strategies for the NMI, ARI and RI depending on the *availability of true labels of patients*. If you upload an empirical pre-determination of subtypes for samples by experts or clinicians based on clinical phenotypes, images or experience, CEPIM will *take it as gold standard to compare*. If you donâ€™t have any subtype information, CEPIM will calculate the NMI and ARI *between every two methods from k=2 to the k-max*.

The second part shows the performance of each method, including summary information of all metrics (only in scenario 2 and 4, see Guideline for more details), KM survival curves, and patient similarity heatmaps for different subtype number of each method.
