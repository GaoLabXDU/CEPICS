# CEPIM

CEPIM: a comparison and evaluation platform for integration methods in cancer subtyping.

## How to install

>Download [CEPIM_1.0.1.tar.gz](https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPIM/releases/download/1.0.1/CEPIM_1.0.1.tar.gz). 

Install R package locally from R studio.

We have prepared init.R to help install the packages that CEPIM depends on.

>Download [init.R](https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPIM/raw/master/documents/init.R).

Source init.R in R studio.
```R
source(init.R)
```

## How to use

Just enter the data and some parameters to get the report.
```R
CEPIM(datalist, datatype = c("gaussian", "gaussian", "gaussian"),
    functionList = list('PINS', 'LRA', 'SNF', 'iCluster', 'PFA'),
    evalList = list('Heatmap','KM', 'SI', 'ARI', 'RI', 'NMI'), kMax=5)
```
**Please make sure that MATLAB has been installed on your computer if you want to run PFA.**   
For more details, please see this [Guideline](https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPIM/raw/master/documents/Guideline.docx) or the help in this R package.

## Reports
Here, we present four reports generated by CEPIM for four scenarios. 

>Download [CEPIM Reports for all scenarios and Supplementary Materials](https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPIM/raw/master/documents/CEPIM_Supplementary_Materials.zip).

The reports generated by CEPIM include **two parts**.   
***The first part*** shows the **comparison of subtyping results across different methods and different number of subtypes**, including *time consumption, Cox p-value, NMI, ARI, silhouette coefficient*. Then, we present an *overall samples similarity heatmap* representing a robust prediction for sample pairwise similarities. 

### Time Comsumption

### Cox P-value

### Silhouette Coefficient

There are two comparison strategies for the NMI and ARI depending on the **availability of true labels of patients**. If you upload an empirical pre-determination of subtypes for samples by experts or clinicians based on clinical phenotypes, images or experience, CEPIM will **take it as gold standard to compare**. If you donâ€™t have any subtype information, CEPIM will calculate the NMI and ARI **between every two methods from k=2 to the k-max**.

### NMI and ARI

***The second part*** shows the **performance of each method**, including *summary information of all metrics (only in scenario 2 and 4, see [Guideline](https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPIM/raw/master/documents/Guideline.docx) for more details), KM survival curves, and patient similarity heatmaps* for different subtype numbers of each method.
